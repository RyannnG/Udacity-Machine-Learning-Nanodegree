# Project 3: Unsupervised Learning
## Creating Customer Segments

### Project Overview
In this project you will apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. You will first explore the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, you will preprocess the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, you will apply PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, you will compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.

### Project Highlights
This project is designed to give you a hands-on experience with unsupervised learning and work towards developing conclusions for a potential client on a real-world dataset. Many companies today collect vast amounts of data on customers and clientele, and have a strong desire to understand the meaningful relationships hidden in their customer base. Being equipped with this information can assist a company engineer future products and services that best satisfy the demands or needs of their customers.

Things you will learn by completing this project:

+ How to apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
+ How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
+ How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
+ How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
+ How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

Udacity recommends our students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the notebook `customer_segments.ipynb` notebook file. Additional supporting code can be found in `renders.py`. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `creating_customer_segments/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook customer_segments.ipynb```
```jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is included as `customers.csv`. You can find more information on this dataset on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers) page.
